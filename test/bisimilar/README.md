Examples in this folder are strongly bisimilar, and thus also weakly bisimilar.

### vk-fin-st3

This is an adapted test case from the original Pifra paper. Here, just the registers are shifted. In this example the support for globally fresh transitions is tested.

### cleav-bag

This is an example of infinite control. The execution of pisim22 on these models does not verify the expected equivalence as pifra fails to produce a finite LTS for the Bag process.
